# LLM for Sublime Text

**Fork of [tonylchang/sublime-llm](https://github.com/tonylchang/sublime-llm), optimized for Mac LLM inference using [oMLX](https://github.com/jundot/omlx).**

A chat interface for LLMs inside Sublime Text 4. Run local models on Mac with oMLX (optimized), or use hosted providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek) for cloud inference.

Use it for:

- Conversational coding help without leaving the editor.
- Sending a code selection into the chat with one keystroke.
- Local, private Mac inference via oMLX (optimized, default).
- Hosted cloud models when you need them (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek), with provider config and API keys stored securely outside dotfiles scope.

## Install

### Manual install (development / pre-publish)

1. Locate your Packages directory:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\`
2. Clone or symlink this repository into that directory as `LLM`:

   ```
   ln -s <path-to-clone> '<packages-dir>/LLM'
   ```

3. Restart Sublime Text.

The plugin requires Sublime Text build **4050 or newer** (Python 3.8+ plugin host).

## Quickstart: oMLX (optimized for Mac, default)

oMLX provides optimized LLM inference for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. No network egress, local-only inference.

1. Install oMLX: https://github.com/jundot/omlx
2. Start the server and generate an API key in the oMLX admin interface.
3. Store the API key in `~/.config/sublime-llm/config.json` under `providers.omlx.api_key`.
4. In Sublime: `Tools -> LLM: Open Chat` (or use the command palette: `LLM: Open Chat`).
5. Type a message after the `<user> ` prompt.
6. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (macOS: `Cmd+Enter`) to send.

Default settings already point at local oMLX:

- `provider`: `"omlx"`
- `base_url`: `"http://localhost:8000/v1"`
- `model`: `"Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-MLX-8bit"` (default oMLX model)

Use `LLM: Choose Model` to switch models, or update `providers.omlx.model` in `config.json`.

If oMLX isn't running, the plugin reports `oMLX (UNREACHABLE)` in the provider menu.

## Hosted cloud providers

Beyond local oMLX inference, you can use hosted cloud providers. To configure OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, update `api_key` in `config.json`:

   ```json
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "REPLACE_ME_with_sk-...",
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "model": "gpt-4o"
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "REPLACE_ME_with_sk-ant-...",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    },
    "openrouter": {
      "api_key": "REPLACE_ME_with_sk-or-...",
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
      "referer": "",
      "title": "LLM"
    },
    "deepseek": {
      "api_key": "REPLACE_ME_with_sk-...",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com",
      "model": "deepseek-v4-flash"
    },
   ```
   Update `model` to change the default model or select "LLM: Choose Model" from the command palette to pick a specific model from the chosen provider.

## External provider config and API keys

LLM keeps provider-level settings outside Sublime's settings file. The default external config path is `~/.config/sublime-llm/config.json` on macOS / Linux, or `%APPDATA%\sublime-llm\config.json` on Windows. A template is shipped as [`config.example.json`](config.example.json).

Example:

```json
{
  "active_provider": "omlx",
  "providers": {
    "omlx": {
      "base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
      "model": "Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-MLX-8bit"
    },
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "sk-...",
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "model": "gpt-4o"
    },
    "custom": {
      "api_key": "...",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
      "model": "local-model",
      "label": "LM Studio"
    }
  }
}
```

Provider settings are read from `providers.<name>` and can include `base_url`, `model`, `api_key`, `referer`, `title`, `models`, or `label` depending on the provider. `active_provider` selects the provider when `provider` is not set elsewhere.

API keys are resolved in this order and the first match wins:

1. **Environment variable** — `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or `CUSTOM_API_KEY`.

   On macOS, GUI apps launched from the Dock or Spotlight do **not** inherit environment variables from your shell rc — they're children of `launchd`, not of your shell. Either launch Sublime from a terminal (`subl`), or use the external config file instead. The same caveat applies on Linux for apps launched via desktop entry files that don't source a shell.

2. **External config file** — `config.json` at the path above, with `api_key` under `providers.<name>.api_key`.

3. **Legacy key-only file** — existing `secrets.json` installs are still read for backward compatibility. New installs should use `config.json`; new writes go to `config.json`. The old key-only shape is:

   ```json
   {
     "openai": "sk-...",
     "anthropic": "sk-ant-...",
     "openrouter": "sk-or-...",
     "deepseek": "sk-...",
     "custom": "..."
   }
   ```

4. **Settings file** — `<Packages>/User/LLM.sublime-settings`. **Disabled by default.** Set `"allow_secrets_in_settings_file": true` to opt in. Not recommended: this file is commonly committed to dotfiles repos and synced via cloud services. If a key is present in the settings file while the opt-in is off, the plugin logs a warning and ignores it.

On POSIX systems, the plugin checks external config and legacy key-only file permissions and warns if they're looser than `0600`. When the plugin itself writes the external config file, it enforces `0600` on the file and `0700` on the parent directory. **This path is outside the usual dotfiles-symlink scope and is the recommended default for most users.**

Whenever a key is resolved, it is registered with the logger's redacting filter so it cannot accidentally appear in log output, even from third-party libraries.

You can verify which source a key came from with `LLM: Show External Config Status`. The display masks all but the last four characters of every key.

### Recommended .gitignore

If you sync your Sublime user directory to git or a cloud drive, add:

```
# LLM local/private config
config.json
secrets.json
LLM.sublime-settings
```

If you absolutely must check in `LLM.sublime-settings`, leave `allow_secrets_in_settings_file` at its default (`false`) so that any stray key in that file is ignored at runtime.

## Keybindings

Default bindings:

| Key (Linux / Windows) | Key (macOS) | Context | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Enter` | `Cmd+Enter` | inside the chat view | Submit the current input region. |
| `Ctrl+Shift+L` | `Cmd+Shift+L` | any view, with a non-empty selection | Send the selection to the chat view as a fenced code block. |
| `Esc` | `Esc` | chat view, while streaming | Cancel the in-flight response. |

All commands are also reachable via the command palette under the `LLM: ` prefix:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LLM: Open Chat` | Open or focus the chat view (creates a side group if needed). |
| `LLM: Submit Message` | Send the current input region. |
| `LLM: Send Selection to Chat` | Pre-fill chat input with the current selection wrapped in a fenced code block. |
| `LLM: Cancel` | Cancel an in-flight stream. |
| `LLM: Choose Model` | Quick-panel model picker. |
| `LLM: Choose Provider` | Quick-panel provider picker with health badges. |
| `LLM: Show Status` | Diagnostic display: provider, model, health, model count. |
| `LLM: Show External Config Status` | Per-provider key source, last-four-character masked. |
| `LLM: Clear Chat History` | Empty the chat for the current project and remove its on-disk transcript. |

`LLM: Open Chat` is also wired into `Tools -> LLM: Open Chat`. `LLM: Send Selection to Chat` is wired into the editor's right-click context menu when a selection is non-empty.

## Settings reference

General chat settings live in `LLM.sublime-settings` (defaults shipped with the plugin) and can be overridden in `<Packages>/User/LLM.sublime-settings` or per-project in your `.sublime-project` file under `"settings"`. Provider-level settings can also live in the external config file under `providers.<name>`.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `"omlx"` | Active provider. One of `omlx`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `deepseek`, `custom`. |
| `model` | `"Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-MLX-8bit"` | Model identifier for the active provider. The default is the oMLX quickstart model; set another via `config.json`, user settings, or `LLM: Choose Model`. |
| `omlx_base_url` | `"http://localhost:8000/v1"` | oMLX server endpoint. Used by the oMLX provider. |
| `temperature` | `0.7` | Sampling temperature. |
| `max_tokens` | `4096` | Max completion tokens. Required for Anthropic; recommended for OpenAI. |
| `system_prompt` | `""` | Optional system message prepended to each conversation. |
| `allow_secrets_in_settings_file` | `false` | If `true`, allows hosted-provider keys (`*_api_key` settings) to be read from this settings file. Not recommended. |
| `openrouter_referer` | `""` | Optional `HTTP-Referer` header for OpenRouter analytics. |
| `openrouter_title` | `""` | Optional `X-Title` header for OpenRouter analytics. |
| `anthropic_version` | `"2023-06-01"` | Value of the `anthropic-version` request header. |
| `anthropic_models` | `[]` | Override the model list shown by the Anthropic provider. Empty means use the plugin's built-in default list. |
| `deepseek_models` | `["deepseek-v4-flash", "deepseek-v4-pro"]` | Fallback model list for DeepSeek when `/models` isn't reachable. |
| `omlx_models` | `[]` | Fallback model list for oMLX when `/models` isn't reachable. |
| `custom_base_url` | `""` | Required when `provider` is `"custom"`. Example: `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio. |
| `custom_api_key` | `""` | Optional API key for the custom endpoint (the env var `CUSTOM_API_KEY` and the external config file are preferred). |
| `custom_models` | `[]` | Fallback list if the custom server doesn't expose `/v1/models`. |
| `custom_label` | `"Custom"` | Display label for the custom provider in error messages (e.g. `"LM Studio"`). |

Per-project overrides go in your `.sublime-project`:

```json
{
  "folders": [],
  "settings": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-7"
  }
}
```

**Never put API keys in `.sublime-project` files.** They're commonly committed to source control.

## Chat view conventions

- The conversation is plain Markdown. Each turn starts with a prompt: `<user> ` or `<assistant> ` (an optional <system> ` is also recognized by the syntax).
- The input region is the text after the last `<user> ` prompt — type freely there.
- The chat view is a Sublime scratch buffer; it will not prompt to save on close. Per-project on-disk persistence keeps the conversation across restarts under `Packages/User/sublime-llm/chats/<slug>.md`.
- Fenced code blocks (e.g. ```` ```python ````) get language-specific syntax highlighting via the standard Markdown embedding mechanism. The chat syntax is `ChatMarkdown.sublime-syntax`, shipped with the plugin.
- One active chat per window. Reopening it via `LLM: Open Chat` focuses the existing view instead of creating a new one.

## Sending a selection to chat

With a non-empty selection in any view:

- Right-click and pick `LLM: Send Selection to Chat`, or
- Run `LLM: Send Selection to Chat` from the command palette.

This command ships without a default key binding to avoid clashing with Sublime's built-in `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Cmd+Shift+L` ("Split selection into lines"). To bind it yourself, add to `Packages/User/Default.sublime-keymap` (commented examples are in the plugin's `Default.sublime-keymap`):

```json
{
    "keys": ["primary+shift+l"],
    "command": "sublime_llm_send_selection",
    "context": [
        {"key": "selection_empty", "operator": "equal", "operand": false}
    ]
}
```

(`primary` resolves to `ctrl` on Linux/Windows and `cmd` on macOS.)

The chat view opens (or focuses) and the selection is appended to the input region as a fenced code block. The fence language tag is inferred from the source view's syntax — Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, JSON, YAML, HTML, CSS, Markdown, Rust, Go, Ruby, Java, C++, C, shell, and SQL are recognized; other syntaxes get an empty language tag.

If the chat input already contains text, the selection is appended below a blank line rather than replacing it.

## Troubleshooting

**oMLX not running.** Start the oMLX server following the [oMLX documentation](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) and confirm it's reachable at `http://localhost:8000/v1` (or your configured `omlx_base_url`). The plugin reports `oMLX (UNREACHABLE)` in the provider menu if the server isn't available.

**`Connection refused` or similar errors.** Make sure your `omlx_base_url` is correct and the oMLX server is running. Default is `http://localhost:8000/v1`. The plugin appends `/models` and uses OpenAI-compatible chat endpoints.

**`UNREACHABLE` for a hosted provider.** Check your network and corporate proxy. The plugin issues plain `urllib` requests; it doesn't read `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` env vars automatically (Sublime's bundled Python doesn't include `urllib3` request-level proxy detection).

**`MISSING_CREDENTIAL` / `BAD_CREDENTIAL` for OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek.** Verify the key resolution source with `LLM: Show External Config Status` — it shows whether each key was resolved from env, external config, legacy file, settings, or is missing, with the last four characters masked. If env vars aren't picked up on macOS, see the launchd caveat above.

**Streaming feels slow.** Token batching is set to flush every 50 ms server-side; the actual cadence is dominated by the upstream model. A typing indicator is planned in the post-MVP backlog (ticket H5).

**Chat view is gone.** `LLM: Open Chat` reopens or focuses it. Chat content lives in a scratch buffer; per-project on-disk persistence keeps the conversation across restarts.

**Stream looks corrupted.** A `STREAM_CORRUPTED` message means the plugin received bytes it couldn't parse as the provider's expected wire format. Cancel and retry. If it reproduces, file an issue with the provider name and (sanitized) sample.

## Security

- **No API keys are logged.** The plugin's logger has a redacting filter applied to every handler. The filter masks every key the plugin has resolved this session and also catches common API-key shapes (`sk-...`, `sk-ant-...`, `Bearer ...`) regardless of whether they were registered explicitly.
- **No telemetry.** The plugin makes HTTP requests only to the configured provider's base URL.
- **Keys are resolved per-request.** Changing env vars, `config.json`, or a legacy key-only file takes effect on the next request without restarting Sublime.
- **The external config file gets restrictive permissions** (`0600` on the file, `0700` on its directory) when the plugin writes it. The plugin warns if it reads external config or a legacy key-only file with looser permissions but does not refuse to read it.
- **Settings-file storage is opt-in.** Keys placed in `LLM.sublime-settings` are ignored unless you set `"allow_secrets_in_settings_file": true`. When that opt-in is on, the plugin emits a one-time warning that storing keys there is insecure.
- See [External provider config and API keys](#external-provider-config-and-api-keys) for the recommended storage approach.

## Development

Tests run inside a real (headless) Sublime Text via [UnitTesting](https://github.com/SublimeText/UnitTesting)'s Docker runner, so test code can use the full `sublime` / `sublime_plugin` API. Requirements: Docker, plus a clone of UnitTesting.

Run tests:

```sh
UT=/path/to/UnitTesting   # git clone https://github.com/SublimeText/UnitTesting
"$UT/docker/ut-run-tests" . --package-name LLM
```

Run a single test file:

```sh
"$UT/docker/ut-run-tests" . --package-name LLM --file tests/test_chat_parser.py
```

Use `--dry-run` to verify the Docker/Sublime test environment without running tests. The first run builds the image and installs Sublime Text into a cache volume; later runs are fast.

Notes:

- `--package-name LLM` is required: the package is mounted as `Packages/LLM`, and tests import the plugin as `from LLM.sublime_llm import ...`.
- Test classes subclass `unittesting.DeferrableTestCase`, which also lets a test yield to the Sublime event loop (yield a callable to poll a condition, or an int for a delay in ms) when exercising async editor behavior.

Local install loop:

1. Symlink the repo into your Packages directory.
2. Install [Package Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Reloader) for automatic submodule reload on save.
3. Use the Sublime console (`` Ctrl+` ``) for `view.run_command(...)` and `print` debugging.

Architecture overview: provider abstraction lives in `sublime_llm/providers/base.py`; secret resolution in `sublime_llm/secrets.py`; chat surface in `sublime_llm/chat_view.py` and `sublime_llm/commands.py`.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Please:

- Add unit tests for new logic in `tests/`. Avoid Sublime-dependent imports at module top level so the suite runs without Sublime.
- Keep API-key handling routed through `sublime_llm.secrets.resolve_key`. Never log keys; call `register_secret` (from `sublime_llm.logging_setup`) on any new key material so the redaction filter catches it.
- Match the existing code style: stdlib only, Python 3.8 target, short one-line docstrings at most, no multi-line comment blocks.

Open work and post-1.0 ideas are tracked in the GitHub issue list.
